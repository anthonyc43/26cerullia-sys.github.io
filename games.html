  Ever since I was a little boy I loved video games and technology in general. Video games became my passion. I first fell in love with Minecraft and then I expanded to games like Just Cause 3 and Call of Duty: Ghosts. I originally started out on Microsoft using the Xbox 360 Kinect, then I switched over to Sony and started using the PlayStation 3. I also had a Nintendo 3DS which opened my eyes to games like Dragon Ball Z, Yo-Kai Watch and Mario Kart 7. Then I got older and started using the Sony systems PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 before switching back to Microsoft with the Xbox Series S. Later I realized how good I was with computers and I wanted to take advantage of that, so I joined this class to learn more about computers and video game design. Since then I have been learning a lot about computers and video games. I have made websites, audio and helped edit characters for the games "Echo Chambers" and "Fightatron".My favorite game right now is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022) on the Xbox Series S. I love playing multiplayer with my friends and family. I also enjoy playing Minecraft with my little brother and building cool structures together. Video games have always been a big part of my life and I can't wait to see what the future holds for gaming technology.
